# WorkshopShop

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.1.0.

## Workshop instructions

In this workshop, we will be building a storefront website for selling clothes. The repository has been set up with the basic groundwork, including the installation of all dependencies you will need to build the project.

### Requirements

- Retrieve the list of products from the `assets/products.json` file.
- Manage the Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations of data using the [NgRx](https://ngrx.io/guide/store) state management solution.
- Display the list of products by utilizing the Data View component from [PrimeNG](https://primeng.org/dataview#layout).
- Implement cart functionality that allows users to select items from the product list and add them to their cart. Additionally, enable users to manage the contents of their cart from a separate cart view.

## Setup steps

- Fork repository from this [URL](https://github.com/Khousheish/workshop-shop-spa).
- Clone repository from the generated fork.
- Install dependencies `npm i`.
- Run application `ng serve -o`.

## Submission steps

To submit your solution for review, create a branch with your name and push it to your fork. Then from the main repository create a pull request to `main` and add [@khousheish](https://github.com/Khousheish) as a reviewer.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
